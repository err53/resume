\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm Jason, a software developer and first year undergraduate student at McMaster University,
pursuing a 4-year degree in Computer Science.
I have 2 years of full-stack software development experience, 
and have been programming for well over 6 years.
% change this to focus on what the job wants
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I also have an interest in computer security,
% stemming from my participation in PicoCTF.
Since COVID-19 started, I have also gained an interest in enterprise infrastructure,
and have consequently picked up homelabbing as a hobby.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In high school, I was an executive in my school's CS club,
a lead engineer on the VEX Robotics team,
and president of the 3D printing club.
Furthermore, I have worked on projects with small teams, 
having gone to more than 10 hackathons since the beginning of high school.

\lettersection{Why Doctalk?}
I worked at a relatively small company in my past position,
and enjoyed the working environment and dynamics, 
which is why I was drawn to this position.
I have also had previous experience with many of the tools required for this position,
and would love to continue developing my skills in the field.
% I was particularly interested in the tech stack that was being used.
% I have worked with the Kubernetes stack, as well as Docker/Docker Compose
% while working on my home servers, and I would love to apply my experience
% towards an impactful project.
% The specific application of these tools in cybersecurity is also interesting for me personally,
% as I have an interest in the field, stemming from my participation in CTFs in the past.
% The co-op I was working at before had an agile, fast-moving, and chaotic development cycle, 
% and I hope that working at CGI will allow me to experience a more stable, 
% corporate development cycle, which will help me develop better programming techniques.
% I believe that this position provides a unique opportunity to allow me to expand my skillset.
% I have significant experience working in the field of software development,
% but also experience working with hardware and IT through my homelab hobby.
% I think that your company's drive for automation and technological progress aligns
% with my personal interests.
% Furthermore, I have enjoyed my previous employment in web development and would like to gain more experience in this sector.
% I hope to be able to bring some of the practices I have learned working with modern web frameworks to this position,
% as well as learning more about the field of workflow automation.
% but I would also like to cultivate my skills in infosec.
% Thus, this position at Red Canari would be an ideal choice for me.
% The technologies and projects that this internship provides are particularly interesting,
% and line up with my goals in the future.
% As a major player in the IT space,
% I hope that CGI will allow me to foster my skills in the infrastructure space.
% change this to focus on a trait the job likes
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I also want do work that is impactful for others, 
% and Vidyard's mission to build the future of video delivery aligns with my drive to make a difference.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I've had 2 years of working experience with full-stack web development, 
using modern frontend stacks, as well as backend database and API experience.
Specifically, I worked on sites built with Gatsby, 
a framework dependent on GraphQL queries for static site generation,
as well as RedwoodJS, a Rails-like app that is also highly dependent on GraphQL.
In my previous position at TakingITGlobal, 
I was responsible for writing serverless microservices using Firebase Functions, 
and utilized services provided by PaaS providers, such as AWS's Textract and S3.
For the database of the latter app, I learned how to use Prisma, an ORM with excellent developer ergonomics,
and how to connect it to a PostgreSQL DB.
I've also worked on a RisingYouth mobile app for the application process,
written with React Native/Expo, and React Hook Form for the forms.
% While I don't use Java at my current position, I have taken the AP Computer Science 1 exam, written in Java,
% and believe that I will be able to adapt and learn the stack needed for this position.
% I also have expeience with building authentication, both in personal projects with Firebase Auth,
% as well as at TakingITGlobal, using Auth0.
% I've also had interest in the field of infosec, have attended CTFs in the past, 
% and have experience designing secure solutions.
% Specifically, in the process of building one of the projects I've worked on, FraserVotes,
% I was responsible for analyzing our application's threat model and implementing the asymmetric encryption
% used in it.
% Furthermore, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
% through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
% I've also contributed to open-source, and have even released an accessibility tool to the community 
% as part of my work at my previous employment.
% Given these skills and experiences, I believe I am well suited to the Software Developer/Hacker Co-op at Red Canari.
% As discussed previously, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
% through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
% I've experimented with containerization,
% and am currently running a hyperconverged media and file server,
% with K3S handling application hosting and ZFS handling storage.
I was also responsible for implementing DevOps tooling at my previous position,
using software like Jest and Github Actions,
which has helped to improve developer experience and reduce bugs.
% I was also tasked with working on unfamiliar infrastructure and developing with cutting-edge stacks,
% so I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges that this position will provide.
% Furthermore, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
% through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
% Evidently, I have experience in many of the prerequisite areas for this position,
% and believe I would be a good fit for this Software Developer position.
% Given these my existing passion for this subject and relevant experience,
% I believe I will prove to be an excellent asset to the team at CGI.
% change this to focus on the job requirements and nice-to-haves
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I've had 2 years of working experience with full-stack web development, 
% using modern software stacks like React.
% In my previous internship, 
% I was given plenty of flexibility to experiment with emerging web development paradigms, 
% and was able to quickly build sites with techniques and software I had little experience with previously.
% I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges presented to me in this internship.
% Through my extracurricular leadership roles and team experience, 
% I have been able to cultivate my leadership and teamwork skills respectively,
% and succeed in both large and small projects.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Given these experiences, 
I believe that my skillset matches well with the skills required for this position.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
I'm excited for this opportunity to apply my experience and 
personal interest in web development to this position.
I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
