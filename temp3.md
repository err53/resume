I've recently been getting into the hobby of custom mechanical keyboards.
Some of the builds I've seen online are incredibly impressive, but I thought, if I were to build a custom keyboard, I'd like to have a hand in the design of ALL the parts (or at least the ones that can be reasonably manufactured without injection molding).
Given that I've had previous experience with 3D modelling and 3D printing, I think this is pretty feasible and cost-effective.
Some of my friends have had the same thoughts, so we've been brainstorming ideas for a custom PCB and case design.
Thus, if I were to open a store, I most likely be running a group buy for the case and PCB, if we end up with significant interest. Perhaps I'd sell related parts like keyswitches or keycaps down the line, but I would prioritize making and selling more PCBs and cases, as the only reason I'd be doing this is out of passion for design and the hobby itself, not profit.
