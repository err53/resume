\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm Jason, a software developer and first year undergraduate student at McMaster University,
pursuing a 4-year degree in Computer Science.
I have 2 years of full-stack software development experience, 
and have been programming for well over 6 years.
% change this to focus on what the job wants
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I also have an interest in computer security,
% stemming from my participation in PicoCTF.
Since COVID-19 started, I have also gained an interest in enterprise infrastructure,
and have consequently picked up homelabbing as a hobby.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In high school, I was an executive in my school's CS club,
a lead engineer on the VEX Robotics team,
and president of the 3D printing club.
Furthermore, I have worked on projects with small teams, 
having gone to more than 10 hackathons since the beginning of high school.

\lettersection{Why RBC?}
I have an interest in machine learning and it's applications,
and this position specifically intrigues me.
While I have not taken any formal machine learning courses yet,
I have explored the topic on my own time,
exploring some of the content in Google's Machine Learning Crash Course,
and helping to host a set of lectures at my former high school's CS club
during my grade 12 year.
I hope that this position will help me develop my skill in this area,
and connect with peers who have similar interests and are also driven to do great things.
% I have had an interest in enterprise infrastructure since starting my homelab,
% and working at Purolator could allow me to apply some of my interests to a working environment.
% My previous position was at a relatively small company, and I hope that Purolator
% would allow me to gain experience working at a larger company with more structure.
% I am excited about the VR/AR space, so the listing was particularly interesting for me.
% After learning more about the company, I'm particularly drawn in by the startup-like working environment.
% As a full stack developer, I am a strong believer in tightly integrated software stacks, 
% and the request for a backend dev who also understands the needs of the frontend team also resonates with me.
% The diverse tech stack listed in the position interested me.
% I have had experience for many of the frameworks and web platforms listed in the listing requirements,
% and others that I have interest in learning.
% For example, I've been learning containerization on my own time, and 
% I'm interested in the use of Docker and K8S in this position.
% I have worked with the Kubernetes stack, as well as Docker/Docker Compose
% while working on my home servers, and I would love to apply my experience
% towards an impactful project.
% The specific application of these tools in cybersecurity is also interesting for me personally,
% as I have an interest in the field, stemming from my participation in CTFs in the past.
% The digital-first aspect of the position was also significant for me,
% especially during these uncertain times.
% The co-op I was working at before had an agile, fast-moving, and chaotic development cycle, 
% and I hope that working at CGI will allow me to experience a more stable, 
% corporate development cycle, which will help me develop better programming techniques.
% I believe that this position provides a unique opportunity to allow me to expand my skillset.
% I have significant experience in software development,
% which matches well with the position's requirements, 
% but I would also like to cultivate my skills in infosec.
% Thus, this position at Red Canari would be an ideal choice for me.
% The technologies and projects that this internship provides are particularly interesting,
% and line up with my goals in the future.
% As a major player in the IT space,
% I hope that CGI will allow me to foster my skills in the infrastructure space.
% change this to focus on a trait the job likes
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I also want do work that is impactful for others, 
% and Vidyard's mission to build the future of video delivery aligns with my drive to make a difference.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I've had 2 years of working experience with full-stack web development
using modern frontend stacks, as well as backend database and API experience.
Specifically, at my previous employer, TakingITGlobal,
I worked closely with a team of 2 other students to build React-based applications,
their respective backends, and the necessary DevOps tooling to maintain them.
During this position, I was tasked with working on unfamiliar infrastructure and developing with cutting-edge stacks,
so I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges this ML internship will provide.
I have used Python extensively for school and personal projects, and have also used Java, albeit to a lesser degree.
I also excelled in my first semester's math courses, most notable being my perfect GPA in the linear algebra course.
% I was responsible for rebuilding the RisingYouth site with Gatsby,
% a React-based static site generator, rewriting the backend as serverless Firebase functions,
% and utilized automated deployment and testing frameworks
% such as Github Actions and Jest.
% Specifically, I worked on sites built with Gatsby and RedwoodJS, 
% both of which are utilize React for page rendering.
% Specifically, I worked on sites built with Gatsby, 
% a framework dependent on GraphQL queries for static site generation,
% as well as RedwoodJS, a Rails-like app that is also highly dependent on GraphQL.
% At this position, I've also wrote serverless RESTful microservices using Firebase Functions, 
% and utilized services provided by PaaS providers, such as AWS's Textract and S3.
% I also have experience working with both relational and NoSQL-like databases,
% having used Firebase Firestore and PostgreSQL, using both raw queries and ORMs like Prisma.
% While I don't use Java at my current position, I have taken the AP Computer Science 1 exam, written in Java,
% and believe that I will be able to adapt and learn the stack needed for this position.
% I also have expeience with building authentication, both in personal projects with Firebase Auth,
% as well as at TakingITGlobal, using Auth0.
% I've also had interest in the field of infosec, have attended CTFs in the past, 
% and have experience designing secure solutions.
% Specifically, in the process of building one of the projects I've worked on, FraserVotes,
% I was responsible for analyzing our application's threat model and implementing the asymmetric encryption
% used in it.
% I have used Python for both school and personal projects for the past 3 years,
% and have even led workshops teaching others the basics of Python:
% \url{https://github.com/err53/ocac-python-club}
% As discussed previously, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
% through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
% I've experimented with containerization,
% and am currently running a hyperconverged media and file server,
% with K3S handling application hosting and ZFS handling storage.
% I've also contributed to open-source, and have even released an accessibility tool to the community 
% as part of my work at my previous employment.
% Given these skills and experiences, I believe I am well suited to the Software Developer/Hacker Co-op at Red Canari.

% I was also tasked with working on unfamiliar infrastructure and developing with cutting-edge stacks,
% so I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges that this position will provide.
% Furthermore, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
% through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.


% Given these my existing passion for this subject and relevant experience,
% I believe I will prove to be an excellent asset to the team at CGI.
% change this to focus on the job requirements and nice-to-haves
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I've had 2 years of working experience with full-stack web development, 
% using modern software stacks like React.
% In my previous internship, 
% I was given plenty of flexibility to experiment with emerging web development paradigms, 
% and was able to quickly build sites with techniques and software I had little experience with previously.
% I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges presented to me in this internship.
% Through my extracurricular leadership roles and team experience, 
% I have been able to cultivate my leadership and teamwork skills respectively,
% and succeed in both large and small projects.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thank you for your time and consideration.
I'm excited for this opportunity to apply my experience and 
personal interest in backend and fintech
to this position. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
