# My Resume / CV / Cover Letter

https://err53.github.io/resume/resume.pdf

Ideas:
- Semver releases
  - major: new/removed work experience
  - minor: new/removed project
  - patch: description changes, skills changes, personal info updates
- Only build on a latex file change
  - is there a way to auto check dependencies
  - something like `make` for latex that only rebuilds updated pieces?
