\lettersection{About Me}
I'm Jason, a software developer and first year undergraduate student at McMaster University,
pursuing a 4-year degree in Computer Science.
I have 2 years of software development experience, 
and have been programming for well over 6 years.
% change this to focus on what the job wants
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
In addition, I have an interest in DevOps, 
which I have cultivated in the past few years by building a homelab 
and learning about containerization in my free time.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In high school, I was an executive in my school's CS club,
a lead engineer on the VEX Robotics team,
and president of the 3D printing club.
Furthermore, I have worked on projects with small teams, 
having gone to more than 10 hackathons since the beginning of high school.

\lettersection{Why CGI?}
The technologies and projects that this internship provides are particularly interesting,
and line up with my goals in the future.
As a major player in the IT space,
I hope that CGI will allow me to foster my skills in the infrastructure space.

% and <COMPANY_NAME>' mission to build the future of communications aligns with my drive to make a difference.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\lettersection{Why Me?}
Over the past 2 years, I have spearheaded my team's effort at TakingITGlobal to utilize DevOps tools, 
improving developer experience and reducing bugs.
I was also tasked with working on unfamiliar infrastructure and developing with cutting-edge stacks,
so I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges that this position will provide.
Furthermore, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
Given these my existing passion for this subject and relevant experience,
I believe I will prove to be an excellent asset to the team at CGI.
% change this to focus on the job requirements and nice-to-haves
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I working experience with full-stack web development, 
% using modern software stacks like React.
% In my previous internship, 
% I was given plenty of flexibility to experiment with emerging web development paradigms, 
% and was able to quickly build sites with techniques and software I had little experience with previously.
% I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges presented to me in this internship.
% Through my extracurricular leadership roles and team experience, 
% I have been able to cultivate my leadership and teamwork skills respectively,
% and succeed in both large and small projects.
