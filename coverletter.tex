\lettersection{About Me}
I'm Jason, a software developer and first year undergraduate student at McMaster University,
pursuing a 4-year degree in Computer Science.
I have 2 years of full-stack software development experience, 
and have been programming for well over 6 years.
I believe in doing things right,
and have pushed for improving software longevity 
and developer experience in the projects I have worked on.
% change this to focus on what the job wants
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I also have an interest in computer security,
% stemming from my participation in PicoCTF.
Since COVID-19 started, I have also gained an interest in the field of infrastructure,
and have consequently picked up homelabbing as a hobby.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
% In high school, I was an executive in my school's CS club,
% a lead engineer on the VEX Robotics team,
% and president of the 3D printing club.
% Furthermore, I have worked well on numerous team projects, 
% having gone to over 10 hackathons and even being in charge of organizing one.

\lettersection{Why The MRG Group?}
% I had a great experience working at a non-profit organization in the past,
% so the opportunity to continue building software for a good cause intrigued me.
% I'm a strong believer in automating as much of the developer workflow as possible,
% which also lines up well with the philosophy and required skills presented at Benevity.
% I have experience working on full-stack applications,
% which I believe lines up well with the requirements of this position.
% I have previously heard of Tucows when looking into registering my own domain,
% and think that working here would be particularly interesting.
% The fully-remote nature of the position was also attractive,
% especially during the continued pandemic restrictions.
I have experience working on full-stack applications, 
and the specific request for full-stack developers in the job posting intrigued me.
% The digital-first aspect of the position was also significant for me,
% especially during these uncertain times.
% The co-op I was working at before had an agile, fast-moving, and chaotic development cycle, 
% and I hope that working at CGI will allow me to experience a more stable, 
% corporate development cycle, which will help me develop better programming techniques.
I believe that this position provides a unique opportunity to allow me to expand my skillset.
% I have significant experience in software development,
% which matches well with the position's requirements, 
% but I would also like to cultivate my skills in infosec.
% Thus, this position at Red Canari would be an ideal choice for me.
% The technologies and projects that this internship provides are particularly interesting,
% and line up with my goals in the future.
% As a major player in the IT space,
% I hope that CGI will allow me to foster my skills in the infrastructure space.
% change this to focus on a trait the job likes
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I also want do work that is impactful for others, 
% and Vidyard's mission to build the future of {area} aligns with my drive to make a difference.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I've had 2 years of full-stack web dev experience at TakingITGlobal,
a non-profit focused on building SaaS sites for government initiatives.
Specifically, I worked on sites built with Gatsby, 
a framework dependent on GraphQL queries for static site generation,
as well as RedwoodJS, a Rails-like app that is also highly dependent on GraphQL.
For the database of the latter app, I learned how to use Prisma, an ORM with excellent developer ergonomics,
and how to connect it to a PostgreSQL DB.
At this position, I've also wrote serverless microservices using Firebase Functions, 
and utilized services provided by PaaS providers, such as AWS's Textract and S3.
In addition to working on new projects, 
I was also tasked with helping maintain the company's existing PHP sites and APIs (built on the Symfony framework).
% While I have not used Python to develop microservices in a professional manner,
% I have had experience working with the language through both 3 years of academic courses,
% and personal use.
% I also have expeience with building authentication, both in personal projects with Firebase Auth,
% as well as at TakingITGlobal, using Auth0.
% I've also had interest in the field of infosec, have attended CTFs in the past, 
% and have experience designing secure solutions.
% Specifically, in the process of building one of the projects I've worked on, FraserVotes,
% I was responsible for analyzing our application's threat model and implementing the asymmetric encryption
% used in it.
% Furthermore, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
% through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
% I've also contributed to open-source, and have even released an accessibility tool to the community 
% as part of my work at my previous employment.

% Given these skills and experiences, I believe I am well suited to the Software Developer/Hacker Co-op at Red Canari.
As I have had great interest in infrastructure, 
I spearheaded my team's effort at TakingITGlobal to utilize DevOps tools such as Jest,
which has helped to improve developer experience and reduce bugs.
% I was also tasked with working on unfamiliar infrastructure and developing with cutting-edge stacks,
% so I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges that this position will provide.
Finally, I have significant experience with Linux and modern enterprise infrastructure,
through my interest in homelabbing and open-source software.
% Evidently, I have experience in many of the prerequisite areas for this position,
% and believe I would be a good fit for this Software Developer position.
% Given these my existing passion for this subject and relevant experience,
% I believe I will prove to be an excellent asset to the team at CGI.
% change this to focus on the job requirements and nice-to-haves
% vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
% I've had 2 years of working experience with full-stack web development, 
% using modern software stacks like React.
% In my previous internship, 
% I was given plenty of flexibility to experiment with emerging web development paradigms, 
% and was able to quickly build sites with techniques and software I had little experience with previously.
% I believe that I will be able to learn and adapt to the challenges presented to me in this internship.
% Through my extracurricular leadership roles and team experience, 
% I have been able to cultivate my leadership and teamwork skills respectively,
% and succeed in both large and small projects.
% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thank you for your time and consideration.
I'm excited for this opportunity to apply my experience and 
personal interest in the field of software to this position.
I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
